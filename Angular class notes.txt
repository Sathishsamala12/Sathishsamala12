What is angular?
It is frontend framework and building blocks of components
What is component?
It is combination of html,ts files.
Ex:
User.component.html
User.component.ts
User.component.css
User.component.spec.ts

DataBinding :data transfer html to ts and ts to html
Component :When we are applying Component metadata on class
The class converts to component
Ex :




Import { Component } from ‘@angular/Core’
@Component(
Selector :’User’,
TemplateUrl:’’

}
Export class UserComponent{



}

Selector : it used to use component as element in another component
TemplateUrl: it used bind html and ts file
Template: we can html in string format 
It have constructor 
We are using constructor dependency injection

DataBinding :data transfer html to ts and ts to html
It is two types
1.One way data binding 
    html to ts
              Event Binding
    ts to html
             Interpolation 
             Property Binding
             Attribute Binding
             Style Binding
             Class Binding 
2.Two databinding 
   Htmlts

Event Binding
Html elements have different types of events 
Button click
Inputblur,input,keyup,keydown
Binding methods to event action ,

Html
 <button  (click)=”Save()”> Save</button>

ts 
Save(){
//code 
}

InterPolation 
data read from ts to html 
ts 
username:string =’kumar’;
html
{{  username }}
{{1+4}}            out 5

Property binding 
Html elements have properties,we can add or remove properties dynamically with help of Property binding 
Ex:
Text box property readonly
If readonly true  we can edit or add values in textbox
HTML
<intput type=”text” [required]=”isedit”>
TS
Isedit:bool=true;
